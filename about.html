            <h2>Why I wanted to become a DIRECTED scholar?</h2>

            <p>I decided to enroll in your bootcamp because I saw this as a great opportunity to learn new skills that could also be a source of income for me. </p>
            <p>Furthermore I did not want to pass on this opprtunity to kickstart my journey into Software engineering before I pursue it in University.</p>
